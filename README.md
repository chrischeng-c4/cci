cci ~/Documents       # Open any directory
```

### Development Installation

```bash
# Clone and install in editable mode
git clone <repository-url> cci
cd cci
pip install -e .

# Or use UV for development
uv sync --all-extras
uv run cci
```

## Features

## Usage

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Features (Claude Code Integration)

```bash
# Send a prompt to Claude Code with project context
cci prompt "explain this function"

# Analyze specific files
cci prompt "refactor for better performance" --file src/main.py

# Multiple file context
cci prompt "find security issues" --file app.py --file config.py

# Control context inclusion
cci prompt "what does this code do?" --no-context

# Include specific file patterns
cci prompt "add type hints" --include "*.py" --exclude "*test*"
```

Claude Code automatically understands:
- Your project structure and files
- Current git branch and changes
- File contents and relationships
- Best practices for your language/framework

No API keys or configuration required - just works!

cci

# Open a specific file
cci README.md
cci ~/Documents/notes.txt

# Open a directory
cci ~/Projects
cci /usr/local/bin

# Open with explicit path
cci .
cci ../parent-directory
```

### Project Management (Optional)
