# Legacy Documentation Below (for reference only)

ultrathink about creating an intelligent finding implementation workflow that seamlessly integrates with the finding-based project-review system and sophisticated subagent orchestration patterns.

## Enhanced Finding-Based Workflow Intelligence

**This command orchestrates complete finding implementation by:**
- **Finding-Based Implementation**: Works with findings from project-review workflow
- **Review Branch Integration**: Assumes we're already on a review branch from project-review
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Leverages subagents with clear phases and parallel execution
- **Finding State Management**: Moves findings through active → in-progress → completed
- **Quality-First Approach**: Multiple validation gates with comprehensive testing

## Core Improvements for Finding-Based Workflow

### 1. Finding Integration
- Reads findings from docs/findings/active/ directory
- Moves findings through workflow states (active → in-progress → completed)
- Updates finding frontmatter with implementation progress
- Supports both specific finding selection and automatic next-priority selection

### 2. Simplified Git Workflow
- Assumes we're already on a review branch from project-review
- Focuses on implementation without branch management
- Commits changes directly to existing review branch
- Updates SESSION.md with implementation progress

### 3. Intelligent Subagent Orchestration
- Clear phase separation with defined inputs/outputs
- Parallel execution where dependencies allow
- Agent specialization with focused responsibilities
- Dynamic workflow adaptation based on finding complexity

### 4. Enhanced Finding Documentation
- Updates finding files with implementation details
- Tracks actual vs estimated effort
- Maintains implementation audit trail
- Updates project progress tracking in SESSION.md

## Workflow Architecture

### Phase 0: Finding Selection & Setup

#### 0.1 Finding Selection & Validation
```bash
@workflow-analyzer: Select and validate finding for implementation:
1. **Finding Selection**
   - If --finding=<id>: Load specific finding from docs/findings/active/
   - If --next or --from-review: Select highest priority finding
   - Validate finding exists and is in active state
   - Ensure finding is not already in progress

2. **Finding Analysis**
   - Parse finding frontmatter (priority, effort_estimate, dependencies)
   - Extract implementation requirements from content
   - Check for any blocking dependencies
   - Validate finding is ready for implementation

3. **State Transition**
   - Move finding from docs/findings/active/ to docs/findings/in-progress/
   - Update frontmatter with started_date and implementation status
   - Update SESSION.md with current implementation progress
```

#### 0.2 Review Context Integration
```bash
@doc-optimizer: Load review context and finding details:
1. **Review Context Loading**
   - Assume we're on review branch from project-review
   - Load SESSION.md for current review context
   - Extract architectural decisions from review
   - Import quality criteria and acceptance criteria

2. **Finding Context Integration**
   - Parse finding requirements and implementation notes
   - Load any referenced documentation or examples
   - Understand finding dependencies and relationships
   - Extract copy-paste prompts and implementation hints

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Use finding-recommended approach
   - Adapt workflow based on finding complexity (effort_estimate)
   - Apply finding-specific quality criteria and testing requirements
```

#### 0.3 Implementation Workflow Planning
```bash
@workflow-analyzer: Design execution strategy based on finding:

Workflow Pattern Selection (based on effort_estimate):
- **Simple Linear** (Small findings: < 2 hours)
  → analyze → test → implement → validate

- **Parallel Development** (Medium findings: 2-6 hours)
  → analyze → [design, test-spec] → [implement, doc] → validate

- **Complex Orchestration** (Large findings: 6+ hours)
  → analyze → design → test-spec → [implement, security, performance] → [doc, validate]

Finding-Based Orchestration Plan:
- Use finding priority to determine validation rigor
- Apply finding-specific testing requirements
- Integrate finding acceptance criteria into validation
- Plan finding completion and state transition
```

   - Track actual vs estimated effort during implementation
   - Move finding: in-progress/ → completed/ (finish implementation)

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update SESSION.md with finding implementation status
   - Track implementation time and complexity
   - Document any issues or deviations discovered
   - Maintain finding audit trail for future reference
```

### Finding Metadata Management

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Failure Modes & Recovery
```markdown
1. **Git Operation Failures**

   - Security issues → Immediate remediation
   - Performance regressions → Optimization required

3. **Agent Failures**
   - Agent timeout → Retry with simplified prompt
   - Context overflow → Reduce context size
   - Tool failures → Fallback to manual steps

4. **Integration Failures**
