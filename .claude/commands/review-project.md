# /review-project

**Trunk-based ultrathink project reviewer** that creates a feature branch, performs deep architectural analysis to evaluate CCI as a modern, stable, and powerful TUI IDE with native Claude Code integration, and generates comprehensive markdown reports with frontmatter metadata saved to `docs/reviews/` directory.

**Paired Command**: Use `/resolve-reviews` after running this command to systematically fix identified issues on the same branch.

**Branch Strategy**: Follows trunk-based development - creates `review/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` branch from main for the review process.

## Overview

Conducts an **ultrathink-level analysis** focusing on:
- **Source Code Quality**: Architecture, patterns, maintainability
- **Test Coverage**: Unit, integration, and E2E test effectiveness
- **Documentation**: README.md, CLAUDE.md, and technical docs
- **Claude Code Integration**: Native AI capabilities assessment
- **TUI Excellence**: Modern terminal UI implementation
- **Stability & Power**: Production readiness evaluation

Results are saved to `reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-review.md` with comprehensive metrics and actionable recommendations.

1. Run: /resolve-reviews  (to fix issues on this branch)
2. Or: gh pr create --draft (to create draft PR for tracking)
3. Or: git checkout main && git merge review/2025-01-17-143022 --no-ff
```

### Example: Quick Review Without Branch
```bash
$ /review-project --quick --no-branch

üîç Running quick review on current branch (main)...
[... review process ...]
üìä Review complete! Report saved to docs/reviews/
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: No branch created, review on current branch
```

## Frontmatter Benefits

The frontmatter in review reports enables:

1. **Machine Readability**: Parse review data programmatically
2. **Status Tracking**: Track resolution progress via `resolved` field
3. **Branch Management**: Know which branch contains fixes
4. **PR Integration**: Link to pull requests and issues
5. **Metrics History**: Track improvement over time
6. **Automation**: CI/CD can read scores and gate deployments

### Example: Reading Frontmatter Programmatically
```python
import yaml
import re

def read_review_metadata(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        # Extract frontmatter
        match = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', content, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            metadata = yaml.safe_load(match.group(1))
            return metadata
    return None

# Use in CI/CD
metadata = read_review_metadata('docs/reviews/latest-review.md')
if metadata['health_score'] < 70:
    print(f"Health score {metadata['health_score']}% too low for deployment")
    exit(1)
```

## Output Examples

### Example: Excellent Project
```markdown
---
health_score: 92
branch: review/2025-01-17-143022
resolved: true
---

Project Health Score: 92%
Claude Code Integration: 98% ‚ú®
TUI Excellence: 89%
Production Readiness: 85%
