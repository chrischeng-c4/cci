# /resolve-reviews

**Intelligent review resolution system** that pairs with `/review-project` to systematically address findings, fix issues, and track resolution progress. Reads review reports from `docs/reviews/` and orchestrates fixes through specialized agents.

## Overview

Acts as the **implementation partner** to `/review-project`:
- **Reads Review Reports**: Parses findings from `docs/reviews/*.md`
- **Prioritizes Issues**: Addresses critical ‚Üí high ‚Üí medium priority items
- **Orchestrates Fixes**: Uses specialized agents for each issue type
- **Tracks Progress**: Updates review status and documents resolutions
- **Validates Fixes**: Ensures each fix meets quality gates

## Usage

```bash
# Resolve issues from latest review
/resolve-reviews

# Resolve from specific review file
/resolve-reviews --review=2025-01-16-project-review.md

# Focus on critical issues only
/resolve-reviews --priority=critical

# Resolve specific category
/resolve-reviews --category=tests
/resolve-reviews --category=linting
/resolve-reviews --category=type-checking

# Dry run to see resolution plan
/resolve-reviews --dry-run

# Continue previous resolution session
/resolve-reviews --continue
```

## Options

- `--review=<filename>`: Specific review file to resolve (default: latest)
- `--priority=<level>`: Focus on specific priority (critical/high/medium/low)
- `--category=<type>`: Focus on issue category (tests/linting/types/coverage/docs)
- `--dry-run`: Show resolution plan without executing
- `--continue`: Continue from last resolution session
- `--parallel`: Enable parallel resolution where safe
- `--validate-only`: Just validate previous fixes
- `--max-issues=<n>`: Limit number of issues to resolve

## Resolution Workflow

### Phase 1: Review Analysis & Planning
```markdown
@review-analyzer: Parse and analyze review report:

1. **Load Review Report**
   - Read from docs/reviews/ (latest or specified)
   - Parse executive summary and scores
   - Extract critical issues list
   - Identify actionable recommendations
   - Map issues to resolution strategies

2. **Prioritize Issues**
   - Critical issues (üî¥): Must fix immediately
   - High priority (üü°): Should fix soon
   - Medium priority (üü¢): Nice to have
   - Sort by impact and effort

3. **Create Resolution Plan**
   - Group related issues for batch fixing
   - Identify dependencies between fixes
   - Estimate time for each resolution
   - Plan validation approach
```

### Phase 2: Issue Categorization & Agent Assignment

@workflow-coordinator: Assign specialized agents to issue categories:

Issue Categories & Agents:
1. **Test Failures** ‚Üí @tester
   - Fix failing tests
   - Add missing tests
   - Improve coverage

2. **Type Checking Errors** ‚Üí @type-fixer
   - Add missing type annotations
   - Fix type incompatibilities
   - Resolve generic type issues

3. **Linting Violations** ‚Üí @code-cleaner
   - Fix style violations
   - Remove unused imports
   - Resolve formatting issues

4. **Architecture Issues** ‚Üí @architect
   - Fix design problems
   - Improve module structure

   - Remove hardcoded secrets
```

### Phase 3: Systematic Resolution Execution

#### 3.1 Critical Issues Resolution (Priority 1)
```markdown
For each critical issue from review:

@implementer + specialized agent:
1. **Understand Issue**
   - Read issue description
   - Analyze root cause
   - Plan fix approach

2. **Implement Fix**
   - Make minimal necessary changes
   - Follow project conventions
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Validate Fix**
   - Run relevant tests
   - Verify issue resolved
   - Check for regressions

4. **Document Resolution**
   - Update resolution log
   - Note any side effects
   - Record validation results
```

#### 3.2 Test Suite Fixes
```markdown
@tester: Fix failing tests systematically:

Test Resolution Strategy:
1. **Analyze Failures**
   - Group related test failures
   - Identify common root causes
   - Prioritize by impact

2. **Fix Test Issues**
   ```python
   # Example: Fix TUI widget selector issues
   - Update widget queries to match current implementation
   - Fix mock configurations
   - Resolve async test issues
   - Update test fixtures
   ```

3. **Improve Coverage**
   - Add tests for uncovered critical paths
   - Create integration tests
   - Add edge case tests
```

#### 3.3 Type Checking Fixes
```markdown
@type-fixer: Resolve type checking errors:

Type Fix Strategy:
1. **Categorize Errors**
   - Missing annotations: Add type hints
   - Incompatible types: Fix assignments
   - Generic issues: Specify type parameters

2. **Apply Fixes**
   ```python
   # Example fixes
   - Add return type annotations
   - Fix Optional type usage
   - Resolve Any type issues
   - Add generic type parameters
   ```

3. **Validate Type Safety**
   - Run mypy check
   - Verify no new errors
   - Document type decisions
```

#### 3.4 Linting & Code Quality
```markdown
@code-cleaner: Clean up code quality issues:

Cleanup Strategy:
1. **Auto-fixable Issues**
   ```bash
   # Run auto-fixes
   uv run ruff format src tests --fix
   uv run ruff check src tests --fix
   ```

2. **Manual Fixes**
   - Refactor long functions
   - Improve variable naming
   - Reduce complexity
   - Remove dead code

3. **Validation**
   - Run linters
   - Check code metrics
   - Ensure standards met
```

## Integration with Review Workflow

### Paired Command Design
```markdown
/review-project ‚Üí /resolve-reviews

1. **Review Phase** (/review-project)
   - Analyzes project comprehensively
   - Identifies all issues
   - Generates review report
   - Saves to docs/reviews/

2. **Resolution Phase** (/resolve-reviews)
   - Reads review report
   - Plans fix strategy
   - Executes resolutions
   - Updates review status

3. **Validation Phase** (/review-project --compare)
   - Re-runs review
   - Compares with previous
   - Confirms improvements
   - Documents progress
```

### Continuous Improvement Loop
```bash
# Iteration 1
/review-project                    # Identify issues
/resolve-reviews --priority=critical  # Fix critical issues
/review-project --compare          # Verify improvements

# Iteration 2
/resolve-reviews --priority=high   # Fix high priority
/review-project --compare          # Check progress

# Iteration 3
/resolve-reviews --priority=medium # Polish remaining
/review-project --compare          # Final validation
```

## Resolution Strategies

### Intelligent Batching
```markdown
Group related issues for efficient resolution:
- All test failures together
- All type errors together
- All linting issues together
- Related architectural changes together
```

### Parallel Execution
```markdown
Safe parallel resolution:
- Type fixes + Lint fixes (independent)
- Test fixes + Documentation (independent)
- Different module fixes (if isolated)

Sequential requirements:
- Architecture changes ‚Üí Implementation
- Core fixes ‚Üí Integration tests
- API changes ‚Üí Documentation
```

### Rollback Safety
```markdown
Each resolution is atomic:
1. Create checkpoint before fix
2. Apply resolution
3. Validate immediately
4. Rollback if validation fails
5. Document any rollback
```

## Success Metrics

### Resolution Success
- All critical issues resolved
- Validation passes for each fix
- No regressions introduced
- Improvements measurable
- Documentation updated

### Quality Metrics
- Health Score improvement
- Test coverage increase
- Type safety improvement
- Linting compliance
- Performance gains

### Efficiency Metrics
- Time per issue resolved
- Parallel execution utilization
- First-attempt success rate
- Rollback frequency

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Critical**: Always resolve critical issues first
2. **Validate Often**: Check after each resolution batch
3. **Document Everything**: Track what was fixed and how
4. **Use Parallel**: Enable parallel for faster resolution
5. **Compare Reviews**: Run review-project after resolution
6. **Incremental Progress**: Resolve in priority batches
7. **Track Metrics**: Monitor improvement trends

## Conclusion

The `/resolve-reviews` command creates a systematic approach to addressing project issues identified by `/review-project`, ensuring continuous improvement through intelligent orchestration, specialized agents, and comprehensive tracking.
