## Validation Rules

### Coverage Requirements
```python
coverage_rules = {
    "minimum": 90,
    "target": 95,
    "critical_paths": 100,
    "new_code": 100
}
```

### Performance Thresholds
```python
performance_limits = {
    "workflow_duration": "15 minutes",
    "phase_timeout": "5 minutes",
    "memory_usage": "500MB",
    "token_usage": "1000 per file"
}
```

### Quality Standards
```python
quality_standards = {
    "linting": "zero errors",
    "type_coverage": "100%",
    "documentation": "complete",
    "security": "no vulnerabilities"
}
```

## Continuous Improvement Tracking
