- Assess risks
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis
```markdown
1. Merge analyzer and validator reports
2. Resolve any conflicts or discrepancies
3. Apply strategic prioritization
4. Generate unified recommendations
5. Create actionable prompts
```

### Phase 4: Report Generation
```markdown
Generate comprehensive review report with:

## 🚨 Critical Findings

### 1. Documentation Ahead of Code
**These features are documented but not implemented:**

#### Feature: Git Worktree Management
- **Status**: 📝 Documented, ❌ Not Implemented
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH
- **Location**: Documented in CLAUDE.md
- **Impact**: Core functionality missing
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours

**📋 Copy-Paste Prompt:**
```
Implement git worktree management functionality as documented in CLAUDE.md.
Create src/cci/core/worktree.py with:
- GitWorktree class for worktree operations
- Methods: create_worktree(), list_worktrees(), switch_worktree()
- Integration with project registry
- Tests in tests/unit/test_worktree.py
Follow the existing code patterns in src/cci/core/registry.py
```

### 2. Code Ahead of Documentation
**These features are implemented but not documented:**

#### Feature: TUI Screens
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented, 📝 Not Documented
- **Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM
- **Location**: src/cci/tui/screens/welcome.py
- **Impact**: Users don't know about TUI features
- **Effort**: 30 minutes

**📋 Copy-Paste Prompt:**
```
Document the TUI features implemented in src/cci/tui/.
Update README.md with:
- TUI usage instructions
- Available screens and navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts
Create docs/user-guide/tui.md with detailed TUI documentation
```

### 3. Misaligned Logic
**These features have inconsistencies:**

#### Feature: Project Configuration
- **Status**: ⚠️ Misaligned
- **Issue**: Docs say TOML config, code uses Pydantic models only
- **Priority**: 🟠 HIGH
- **Impact**: Configuration not persistable

**📋 Copy-Paste Prompt:**
```
Align project configuration with documentation.
Implement TOML configuration loading/saving:
1. Add config.py with load_config() and save_config()
2. Update Project model to serialize/deserialize from TOML
3. Add tests for configuration persistence
4. Update CLI to use config files
The docs specify ~/.config/cci/config.toml structure - implement this.
```

## Coordination Strategies

### Parallel Execution
```python
# Launch multiple agents simultaneously
agents = [
    Task("project-review-analyzer", analyze_params),
    Task("project-review-validator", validate_params),
    Task("test-runner", test_params),
    Task("metrics-collector", metrics_params)
]
results = run_parallel(agents)
```

### Conflict Resolution
```markdown
When agents disagree:
1. Validator takes precedence over analyzer
2. Test results override assumptions
3. User requirements supersede suggestions
4. Recent changes weighted higher
```

### Adaptive Review
```markdown
Adjust review based on:
- Time since last review (incremental vs full)
- Project phase (early vs mature)
- User focus area (if specified)
- Available time (quick vs comprehensive)
```

## Tools Required
- Task: For orchestrating parallel agents
- Read: For understanding project state
- Write: For updating review documentation
- TodoWrite: For tracking action items

## Integration Points
- Receives analysis from project-review-analyzer
- Receives validation from project-review-validator
- Updates docs/reviews/latest.md with findings
- Integrates with /project-review command

## Success Metrics
- Review completion time < 30 seconds
- Actionable recommendations > 80%
- User satisfaction with priorities
- Successful execution of prompts
- Measurable project progress

## Continuous Improvement
After each review:
1. Track which recommendations were followed
2. Measure impact of implemented suggestions
3. Adjust priority weights based on outcomes
4. Refine prompt templates based on success
5. Update decision framework with learnings
