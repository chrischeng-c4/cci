## Why CCI?

CCI reimagines the development workflow by putting AI at the center:

1. **Worktree-First**: Every feature gets its own isolated worktree
2. **Prompt-Driven**: Describe what you want, AI generates the code
3. **Patch Review**: Review changes before applying
4. **No Merge Conflicts**: AI doesn't create conflicts with itself
5. **Full Transparency**: See exactly what AI is doing

## Quick Example

```bash
# Create a new project
cci new ~/my-project --name "My Project"

# Open the welcome screen
cci

# Work with prompts (coming soon)
cci prompt "Add user authentication with JWT"
cci patch review
cci patch apply
```
