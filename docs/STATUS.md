## 🚀 Current Status: Universal Tool Implementation Complete

### ✅ Major Pivot Completed
**CCI is now a universal file/directory tool** - works anywhere, with any file!

### ✅ Latest Implementation
- [x] Created `/cci-smart-commit` Claude command
- [x] Intelligent git commit message generation
- [x] Conventional commit format support
- [x] Context-aware analysis of changes

### ✅ Completed Earlier
- [x] Created AI-first development workflow in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Set up hooks configuration with macOS notifications
- [x] Created slash commands for development workflow
- [x] Configured logging system (logs/ folder)
- [x] Updated .gitignore for proper exclusions
- [x] Established documentation structure
- [x] Initialized Python project with UV
- [x] Created src/cci project structure
- [x] Implemented CLI with Typer (new, open, list, remove commands)
- [x] Built Pydantic models for Project and ProjectConfig
- [x] Created project registry system with TOML persistence
- [x] Designed welcome TUI screen with Textual
- [x] Written comprehensive unit tests (23 tests passing)
- [x] Achieved 88% test coverage on core logic
- [x] Set up MkDocs documentation site
- [x] **MAJOR: Pivoted to universal file/directory tool**
- [x] **Fixed CLI argument parsing for direct path usage**
- [x] **Made project registry optional**
- [x] **Tested system-wide installation**
- [x] **Built distributable package**

### 🎯 How CCI Works Now

```bash
# Universal usage - works anywhere!
cci                    # Open current directory
cci file.txt          # Open any file directly
cci ~/Documents       # Open any directory
cci .                 # Open current directory explicitly

# Optional project management
cci new ~/project     # Create new project
cci list              # List registered projects
cci remove "name"     # Remove from registry
```

### 🚧 Next Implementation Phase
- [ ] File editor/viewer in TUI
- [ ] Directory browser with tree view
- [ ] Git status integration
- [ ] AI-powered features
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Search functionality

### 📋 Technical Achievements
1. **Smart CLI routing** - Automatically detects command vs path
2. **Dual mode TUI** - Adapts to file or directory context
3. **Optional registry** - Project features are optional
4. **Clean architecture** - Separation of concerns
5. **Comprehensive testing** - 88% coverage maintained

### ⚠️ Resolved Issues
- ✅ CLI argument parsing (used sys.argv manipulation)
- ✅ TOML serialization with None values
- ✅ MkDocs symbolic link errors
- ✅ Port conflicts (using 8001)

### 💬 Notes for Human
- CCI is now ready for system-wide installation
- Run `pip install dist/cci-*.whl` to install globally
- Documentation site available at http://127.0.0.1:8001/cci/
- Project is fully functional as a universal tool
