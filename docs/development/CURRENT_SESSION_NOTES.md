# Documentation Accuracy Update - 2025-01-16

## Summary
Updated documentation to reflect accurate test coverage and implementation status based on current test results.

## Key Changes Made

### STATUS.md Updates
- **Test Coverage**: Updated from incorrect claims of 88% to actual 59%
- **Test Status**: Corrected to 134/144 passing (93% pass rate) vs previous claims
- **Project Health**: Increased from 25% to 35% due to test stability improvements
- **Critical Gaps**: Updated to reflect actual issues (10 TUI test failures vs broad claims)
- **Priorities**: Focused on specific, actionable issues vs generic statements
- **Technical Achievements**: Updated test coverage claims to be accurate

### PROGRESS.md Updates
- **Git Worktree Management**: Corrected all items from âœ… to ðŸ“‹ (not implemented)
- **Testing Framework**: Updated CLI/TUI test status to reflect actual coverage and issues
- **TUI Screens**: Marked as ðŸš§ with notes about failing tests vs claiming complete
- **UI Components**: Updated to reflect test failures vs claiming complete
- **Statistics**: Recalculated completion percentages (24.7% vs previous 26.0%)

### TESTING.md Updates
- **Coverage Goals**: Updated to reflect realistic targets based on current state
- Added specific current coverage percentages for different modules
- Set achievable targets (75% overall vs previous 85%+)

### Review Document Updates
- Updated test coverage metric from 34% to 59%
- Changed status from "At Risk" to "Improving"
- Marked test coverage documentation fix as completed

## Actual Current State (Based on Test Results)

### Test Coverage by Module
- **Utilities**: 90%+ (file_utils: 92%, config_utils: 98%, git_utils: 95%)
- **Registry**: 93% (high quality)
- **CLI**: 45% (needs improvement)
- **TUI Screens**: 48-82% (varies by screen, 10 tests failing)
- **Worktree**: 0% (completely unimplemented)
- **Overall**: 59% (134/144 tests passing)

### Key Insights
1. **Test Infrastructure is Strong**: 144 tests total, good coverage patterns
2. **Utility Modules Excellent**: 90%+ coverage shows good foundation
3. **TUI Tests Exist But Fail**: Tests are written but widgets missing selectors
4. **CLI Partially Tested**: 45% coverage, room for improvement
5. **Worktree Gap**: Core feature completely missing (0% coverage)

### Recommendations for Next Session
1. **P0**: Fix 10 failing TUI tests (likely missing widget IDs/selectors)
2. **P0**: Improve CLI test coverage from 45% to 70%+
3. **P1**: Implement worktree module (currently 0% coverage)
4. **P1**: Add integration tests (currently none exist)
