# CCI Project Review - 2025-01-15

## Executive Summary

**Project Health: 25%** - The CCI project has a solid foundation but lacks core functionality. While architecture and testing infrastructure are well-designed, the actual implementation is minimal. The project successfully pivoted from a worktree-first IDE to a universal file/directory tool, but hasn't implemented the features that would make it usable.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Documentation Coverage | 45% | 90% | üî¥ Behind |
| Code Completion | 25% | 100% | üî¥ Critical |
| Test Coverage | 59% | 80% | üü° Improving |
| Alignment Score | 3/10 | 9/10 | üî¥ Misaligned |

## Critical Findings

### 1. Core Functionality Missing (URGENT)
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium

The project pivoted to a universal file/directory tool but lacks basic file operations:
- No file viewing/editing capability in TUI
- No directory browsing functionality
- Only welcome screen implemented

**Action Required**: Implement FileViewerScreen and DirectoryBrowser immediately to make the tool functional.

### 2. Worktree Management Unimplemented
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: High

The central concept of git worktree management is extensively documented but completely missing from the codebase:
- No src/cci/core/worktree.py module
- No GitWorktree class
- No worktree CLI commands

**Action Required**: Implement core worktree functionality as designed in documentation.

### 3. Test Coverage Crisis
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium

Critical components have 0% test coverage:
- CLI commands: 0% coverage
- TUI application: 0% coverage
- Main entry point: 0% coverage

**Action Required**: Add comprehensive tests targeting 80% minimum coverage.

3. **Architecture**: Documented services/ and utils/ directories don't exist
4. **AI Integration**: Central to docs, absent from code
5. **CLI Commands**: Documented commands (worktree, prompt, config) not implemented
6. **TUI Screens**: Only welcome screen exists vs 10+ documented screens
7. **Workflow**: Complex patch/review workflow documented, basic registry implemented

## Prioritized Action Plan

### üî• Immediate Actions (Do Now)

1. **Implement File Viewer**
   - Create FileViewerScreen with syntax highlighting
   - Add save functionality
   - Connect to CLI file_path parameter

2. **Fix Test Coverage**
   - Add CLI command tests
   - Add TUI screen tests
   - Target 80% coverage

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Align STATUS.md with reality
   - Update architecture docs
   - Fix coverage claims

### ‚è±Ô∏è Short-term Goals (This Session)

1. **Directory Browser**
   - Implement tree view widget
   - Add navigation
   - Connect to directory_path

2. **Basic Worktree Management**
   - Create worktree.py module
   - Implement core operations
   - Add CLI commands

3. **Configuration System**
   - Implement 'cci config' command
   - Add validation
   - Create settings UI

### üìÖ Medium-term Goals (Next Session)

1. **AI Integration Foundation**
   - Setup Anthropic SDK
   - Create AI service abstraction
   - Implement prompt processing

2. **Patch Management**
   - Design patch workflow
   - Implement review system
   - Add diff viewing

3. **Advanced TUI Screens**
   - Project view
   - Worktree manager
   - Settings screen

### üìã Long-term Backlog

- Plugin/extension system
- Collaboration features
- Performance optimization
- Auto-updates
- Video tutorials

## Implementation Prompts

### Priority 1: Make TUI Functional
```
Implement basic file viewing and editing in the TUI. Create src/cci/tui/screens/file_viewer.py with:
- FileViewerScreen class using Textual's TextArea widget
- Syntax highlighting support using Pygments
- Read-only and edit modes toggle
- Save functionality (Ctrl+S)
- Integration with existing file_path parameter from CLI
- Error handling for file operations
Make the TUI actually functional for viewing/editing files passed via CLI.
```

### Priority 2: Implement Worktree Management
```
Implement git worktree management as documented. Create src/cci/core/worktree.py with:
- GitWorktree class wrapping GitPython
- Methods: create_worktree(), list_worktrees(), switch_worktree(), remove_worktree()
- Worktree status tracking
- Branch isolation support
- CLI command 'cci worktree' with subcommands: list, create, switch, remove
Follow the architecture described in docs/ and ensure compatibility with existing project structure.
```

### Priority 3: Comprehensive Testing
```
Add comprehensive tests for CLI and TUI components. Create:
1. tests/unit/test_cli_commands.py:
   - Test all CLI command functions
   - Test argument parsing
   - Test error handling
2. tests/unit/test_tui_screens.py:
   - Test welcome screen
   - Test screen transitions
   - Mock user interactions
3. tests/integration/test_cli_tui_interaction.py:
   - Test CLI to TUI handoff
   - Test file/directory parameter passing
Use existing fixtures and pytest-mock patterns. Target 80% coverage minimum.
```

## Quick Wins (Easy Fixes)

1. Create empty services/ and utils/ directories
2. ‚úÖ Fixed STATUS.md test coverage reporting (now accurate at 59%)
3. Implement help action in TUI
4. Add placeholder screens for documented features
5. Create basic configuration validation
6. Add error handling tests

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Clarify Project Identity
**Decision Required**: Is CCI a universal file tool or a worktree-first IDE?
- If universal tool: Update all documentation to reflect this
- If worktree IDE: Prioritize worktree implementation

### 2. Focus on MVP
**Recommendation**: Get basic file operations working before advanced features
- File viewing/editing is table stakes
- Directory browsing is essential
- Everything else can wait

### 3. Test-Driven Development
**Requirement**: No new features without tests
- Current 0% CLI/TUI coverage is unacceptable
- Mandate 80% coverage for new code
- Add tests before fixing bugs

### 4. Documentation Discipline
**Process**: Update docs with every code change
- Keep STATUS.md current
- Update PROGRESS.md after features
- Log decisions in DECISIONS.md

## Progress Since Last Review

This is the first comprehensive review. Future reviews will track:
- Features completed
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation updates
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Identity**: Decide on universal tool vs worktree IDE
2. **Implement File Viewer**: Make the tool actually usable
3. **Add Tests**: Get to 80% coverage
4. **Update Docs**: Align with implementation
5. **Review Again**: Schedule follow-up in one week

## Conclusion

The CCI project has strong architectural foundations but needs immediate attention to core functionality. The gap between documentation and implementation is significant but manageable with focused effort. Priority should be on making the tool functional (file operations) before adding advanced features (AI, worktrees).

**Recommended Focus**: Implement file viewer, add tests, update documentation.
